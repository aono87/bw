module load stacks/2.0Beta9	

## use populations to pull all loci called by gstacks that are variable; minor allele frequency of 0.01 means that at least one individual in 54 has a variable site. This is just the beginning, so it's just to get the variable loci. The popmap file has 154 reference samples in it
